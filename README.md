blockchain profile managment on private network

This application uses the private network setup using geth to run.

you need to redeploy the contract to get the address and abi and paste it into script section of add and view.html

you should mine some ether to do the transaction.

make sure to start the private network on rpc and set address and port to localhost:8585 as web3 will take it as provider.
